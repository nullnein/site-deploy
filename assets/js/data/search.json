    "snippet": "Issues with the story:  Focus unclear: Migration or Refugees in Germany?  Research necessary on:          Food Delivery and Migration (Statistics?)      Amazon and work perspective      entry-level service industry and job security        O-Töne          Balance: Ask for comment                  Amazon          Gorillaz                    Union/Initiative      A rider themselves      »Of course I support a fellow Indian worker in retaining their job,« says my friend Shabnam after I ask her about ordering on Gorillaz. Single-handedly she rebuffs shallow critique about ordering at the food delivery.It is a late evening and being a great host she just virtually went to the kiosk and have somebody bring two more cases of beer. I ask her whether she had already tipped and of course she had, on the app. Me, still feeling guilty that I didn’t contribute to this evening materially and feeling guilty that a migrant worker has to work with Gorillaz, I run downstairs so and tip again.[now background on food delivery and migration]Now with a fresh beer in hand, we keep discussing the business model Gorillaz and Flink. Shabnam says, the jobs are great for Indian students in Germany. Because there aren’t that many entry level jobs that don’t require great command of German.Delivery riding requires no German skills and can be done part-time, so studying is still possible. At the same time students from India often receive have some support from home, so a job like with Gorillaz may suffice.For others, it isn’t enough. Pedro* spent years wrangling with the German migration system. He is seeking asylum for political prosecution in Venezuela. He has a masters degree and work experience in tech so getting a job was actually simple for him in Germany. Nevertheless, he spent [how many?] months in a refugee camp and later refugee accomodation in Leipzig.After you are officially allowed to stay in the country without having your asylum fully approved, German authorities push refugees to find work, Pedro says. Many now find it with Amazon. Their warehouses offer entry level jobs, with no German required and full time positions. But, they offer little future.[add on work perspectives Amazon]But often refugees never enter the official workforce but stay within illicit employment. Pedro noticed cars of construction companies parked outside his refugee accomodation outside Leipzig quickly. »They approach refugees and ask them to work doing basic construction work [which kind?]. They promise 15 to 20 Euros an hour,« says Pedro. [This info should come from somebody else, while Pedro should add emotion: 15 to 20 Euros is great money if you compare it to how much you can make in other jobs.Now, Pedro has friends who sit on piles of cash. Since the money was earned illegally, it cannot be used to rent an appartment or sent home to support their family. »This one friend of mine lives with his employer, they do scaffolding, and his rent is simply deducted from his illicit wage«Many refugees in vulnerable position turn to prostitution however. »I know an albino person who tends to sexual kinks of a whole range of clients,« says Pedro."

Why are they relevant for the topic?      How do they look/sound?

What are the parts of this?

    "snippet": "This week has a theme: Looking at the beast. It follows how to do journalism in 2022, what asset manager capitalism is, and how you scrape twitter.Kaminska off-balance sheetIzabella Kaminska left the Financial Times and now runs her own media venture »The Blindspot«. With her own enterprise she aims twofold: First, figure out how media works by having your own media outlet. And second, being able to push the limits of group think.  In the journalistic field, being innovative means figuring out what  uncomfortable realities should warrant investigations and which should  not. It also means standing up to consensus and pushing ahead on stories that the evidence implies there is something to, even if doing so is  unpopular. Other times it just means finding more compelling media or  mechanisms to bring the stories to market.She also went to do a Reddit AMA, apparently also to simply advertise her new outlet. On it, I enjoyed to read her arguments of »always going against the wind, to be opinionally countercyclical«.With regards to journalism, I found her take on being fresh and new quite enlightening.  If I publish something and it is  clearly proven to be wrong or lacking the consideration of a key point,  it’s important to be transparent, admit the mistake, correct it and move wrong.  We are all human so mistakes will happen. I think your readers are forgiving providing you are transparent.  This is often the case with new topics that you are only beginning to cover. But it’s also important to be a journalistic newbie in my opinion.  Having a fresh perspective is important. There is a fine balance between expertise and freshness. Expert journal can go native in the sectors  they cover. Their sources become their friends. They fear upsetting  people or burning bridges. So you need a continuous  shake up and moving into news sectors you know less about is usually quite good for that,  but you can make early mistakes as you familiarise yourself with the  markets.Blyth on BraunMark Blyth gave a 20 minute lecture on Ben Braun’s work asset manager capitalism (AMC). His introduction on how Ben’s work brings the intellectual shift in political science and sociology after 2008 to a new hight very much resonated. Three points to take away: 1) AMC holds societies hostage over the climate crisis, bringing an unjust future, 2) AMC displays a shift of power to the top 1% because of asset proliferation and risk diffusion to the public, and 3) AMC signals solely wealth preservation and I cannot stop thinking of the Hunger Games.  Blackrock’s Larry Fink’s short squeeze, expecting the public balance sheet to take on all risks; So as Blyth says: »Economic transition but you can forget about all the just part.«  US households as shareholders may be the owners of companies. But looking at the numbers it is precisely the top 1% who own at least 50% of all the shares and the asset managers are their agents. And through ever more ETF issuance on the same underlying collateral, they create more assets for this class »at the cost of creating systemic risk for everybody else.« This is the rise of passive investment takes away the “big pocket investors” (Mehrling), nobody provides an outside spread, but the state/central bank.  For Blyth the biggest takeaway is, that the entrepeneurial function of capitalism is gone. The new paradigma is wealth preservation because shares are assets to generate fees (for asset managers).Twitter download w/o APIHN brought to my attention the possibility to mine twitter data without the use of APIs. Someone linked their GUI Tweetfeast. Others suggested to use the Python option Twit, but I’ve got to admit I don’t know if my pip is actually up and running or not. I’m just glad to have sorted out my Ruby this week.This siteManaged to get this page up and running on https://nullnein.onrender.com/. Happy to share the config soon. Still some stuff to do but learning the whole jekyll game.Artists’ self-preoccupationDie chinesische haute couture Designerin Guo Pei sagt im Zeit Magazin Nr. 6, 3.2.2022:  Haben Sie sich in den vergangenen Jahren viel mit anderen Couturiers in Paris ausgetauscht?  Nicht wirklich. […] Am letzten Abend der Fashion week gibt es ein Dinner, das die Couuture-Kammer veranstaltet. Da sagt man sich kurz Hallo.  Nicht mehr?  Nein. Jeder von uns hat als Künstler bereits seine eigene Welt geschaffen, die so reich ist, dass man sie nicht mehr verlassen will. Wenn du jung bist, stehst du noch in einem leeren Raum, den du mit Dingen von außen füllen willst. Unsere Welt quillt dagegen schon über, der eine Designer hat seine Ideen, ich habe meine, weder ist er auf meine neugierig noch ich auf seine. Mehr als ein Hallo ist nicht nötig.Im engen Kontrast lese ich Heimo Schlinks Hesse Biographie und von Hesses Obsession und kleinteiliger Korrespondenz mit seiner Leserschaft, seinem Austausch mit Hugo Ball, Mann, seinen Briefwechseln mit Frauen und Freunden. Und dennoch scheint auch Hesse mit dieser Einzigartigkeit seines Seins zu spielen, diese geradezu zur Kunstform zu erheben. All sein Schreiben ist doch  Auseinandersetzung mit seiner Person und Schlink schließt sogar, dass Hesses Leiden selbstgewählt ist, um dieses Schreiben erst zu ermöglichen."

    "snippet": "This week brought a crash course into radio. While killing your darlings is important to all work, I’ll mention it here because it hit me here so strongly.The first pieceI did two pieces. One on how DW protects their journalists in Germany, with violence against members of the press increasing, as also NGOs report. For this piece, I interviewed DW’s reporter on right-wing movements who by coincidence also interviewed me during the DW assessment center. I messed up the piece in two ways: I spoke my narration too slowly and then tried to cover it by putting dramatic music. Major learning: Practice speech (more below).The second pieceThen I met Klaus, who runs a currywurst bude just accross from DW, on the Rhine. Beautiful interview, great partner, would like to get back to him again./assets/currywurst-final.mp3Major learnings:  Take your time when getting to a scenery. Have a cup of coffee first, be patient, chill and then figure out where to to the interview.  Hold the microphone really close, otherwise the voice is too low and if you boost the volume there will be background.  Ask them to turn off music to have a quite place for a chat.  Chat to them first, then turn on the machine.  Kill your darlings: I had so many nice quotes but having less in the piece would have been more.Overall learnings  Anmoderation/Narration          Don’t reveal too much in the Anmoderation, make listeners curious; But use Anmoderation to place the story.      Write teaser/Anmoderation first. Then you will know where you’re going.      See Anmoderation and Narration as one unit.      Anmoderation: Put the listener on the track for the first part of the piece      Cappuchino-Effect: Tell your story over a cup of coffee.      Your hook needs to be close to your agenda.      Structuring Narration: Use simple stuff: Sleep, eat, toilet but be aware if the simple structure fits your story      Push background info into the middle of your story, be scenic.      Use your experts to give examples, provide pictures. Put explanation into your narration.      Be aware to portray your people well. Even if they use Phrasen that may portray them, don’t put them, it doesn’t do them justice.        Production:          Have subjects help you: Quiet place, turn off music      Before you go out: Check of your subject can answer your driving question.      If you talk to a customer/visitor, make sure their statement fits/enhances the story      Music works to show something: I.e. cliché music (hip-hop) can introduce a scenery (young people) but is context/audience specific      Always record a lot of long ambience on the ground      Atmo: Is it clear what the Atmo is? Is it aggressive or drunk people yelling? Which picture do you see when hearing the sound?        Technical stuff          The auto-level can boost background noise in short breaks of speech      Clean »ahs« from soundbites      Check level of recorded voice visually on recording device      Check level of ambience with your ears through headphones      Sinnverstehendes LesenAndreas nennt ordentliches Sprechen für’s Radio »Sinnverstehendes Lesen«, das Internet verortet den Begriff in der Grundschule.Wichtige Punkte:  Text nicht in Grammatik unterteilen, sondern in Sinnabschnitte  Text durchgehen und markieren:          Pausen      Binden      Stimme Runter        Immer ganz einatmen, dann kommt man auch weit  Geschwindigkeit: Wie mit einem normalen Menschen reden  Fragezeichen: Stimme hoch, Betonung auf Fragewort  Deutsche Bühnenhochlautung:          Endung -ig: König wird Könich      Endung -en: Essen wird Essn      Im Zweifel: Aussprachedatenbank      "

    "snippet": "  The Third Pole is a publication on issues related to the climate crisis with a special focus on Global South countries. They make strong use of linking to scientific papers and interlinking other reporting.          I was especially taken by their report on natural calamities causing mental health issues in northern Pakistan. Apparently, mental health effects of the climate crisis are understudied.      They make wide use of linking to scientific papers, i.e. this one that argues for causal link between higher female representation in national parliaments and stronger climate policy outcomes.        Reuters produced a clever and simple explainer on the Tonga erruption using a gif of the ash plume overlaid onto various landmasses for context.

    "snippet": "Natürlich war es eine Auszeichnung von Bärbel ein Briefchen zu bekommen. Er war ja nicht der Hübscheste. Zugesteckt zwischen den Schulbänken, hin und her, bis Peter sie nach Hause bringen durfte. Aus der Schule raus und durch die Kleinstadt hindurch, an seinem Elternhaus vorbei und dann diese Stiege hoch, spazierten die beiden. Damals hieß das: Miteinander gehen.Zum Zwischenstop saßen sie auf einer Bank, sie 14, er 14, unromantisch, ohne Weitblick, einfach nebeneinander. Denn verborgen sollte es sein.Doch Peter war forsch, fragte, ob er sie nicht die Lateinvokabeln abfragen dürfe. Zuhause natürlich. Denn ungetört mussten sie sein. Blicke umher, ob da nicht jemand kommt und dann kurz, ein Kuss. Nur kurz. Ein Aufeinandertreffen zweier Münder. Denn was sollten die Leute denken.Jetzt ist er 80 und Peter steht stramm, kugelrund und sein Schnurrbart formt seinem Schmunzeln einen wohligen Unterschlupf. Er sieht sich um und raunt: »Nicht, dass meine Frau von der Geschichte erfährt.«Kommentar:  Starker Schluss, Pointe: Elegant mit Zitat aufhören  Gute Szenerie  Kürze bringts"

    "snippet": "Plötzlich stehen die Schlagzeilen einfach so in der Luft. Fred Muvunis lange, geraden Finger einfach so Trump und Djokovic beiseite gewischt. Nun wird in diesen Zeilen Politik aus der Sicht von Bauern und Arbeitern erzählt.Der Mann aus Ruanda ist heute Stratege für die Deutsche Welle, den Auslandssender der Bundesregierung. Jetzt will er die Medien verändern, so dass sie nicht jeder politischen Finte auflaufen. Denn er hat es alles gesehen: Hunger, Völkermord und die Bedrohung des eigenen Lebens.Fred Muvuni kommt 1981 in einem Flüchtlingslager in Uganda zur Welt. Sein Vater war als Tutsi aus Ruanda vertrieben worden. Bekannte zogen ihn auf, aber das Essen war knapp, manchmal Tage und Wochen, ohne etwas zu essen. Der Hunger ist nichts, keine Energie, keine Gedanken, kein Tun. Muvuni war benommen und taub. Nur eins wusste er: Er würde nicht sterben.Noch in Uganda schloss sich Muvuni als 10-Jähriger Tutsi-Truppen an. Damals Normalität für Jungen, die nicht wissen was es bedeutet zu töten, die aber eine Waffe tragen wollen. Zur Invasion wurden die Kinder 1992 nach Ruanda gefahren, zu hunderten wie Hühner in Lastwägen gepfercht. Fred Muvuni weiß nur von drei Kameraden aus den Lastwägen, die drei Jahre später noch lebten.Nach dem Krieg formte sich in seinem Kopf ein Gedanke, der ihn immer noch trägt: „Ich wollte wichtig sein. Ich wollte nicht umsonst sterben“. Er nennt es ein fantastisches Wunder der Entschlossenheit, dass er sein Mathematik-Studium abschloss. Nachts stand er dafür mit einem Gewehr an der Schulter vor dem Haus eines Geheimdienstoffiziers. Tags fuhren ihn die Beamten mit ihren dicken Autos zur Uni.Der Fußball brachte Muvuni später zum Journalismus. Erst berichtete er über Sport, dann Menschenrechtsthemen und stieg schnell auf. Als Vorsitzender der Ruanda Media Company sollte er dann auf Geheiß Präsident Kagames die britische BBC abwickeln. Muvuni widersprach.Der Sicherheitsapparat in Ruanda reagierte. Verhöre, ein erzwungenes Geständnis und Muvuni fürchtete um sein Leben. Später in Brüssel schickte Kagame noch einmal seine Häscher. Aber Fred Muvuni blieb Journalist.Bei der Deutschen Welle will er Nachrichten aus der Sicht einfacher Leute zu erzählen. Aber für diese Bestimmung sterben, das will er nicht."

Mit festem Griff schiebt dieser Käufer seinen leeren Einkaufswagen weiter. Bis zu Gang vier klafft vor ihm dieses Drahtgestell, dann ein aufmerksamer Blick zu den Angeboten von Pfanni. Wache, flinke Augen blicken hinab in Richtung der grell roten Preisschilder. Aber dieser Konsument sucht etwas anderes.An der letzten Einfahrt macht er halt, dreht den Wagen und geht hinein. Langsamen Schrittes vorbei am Veltins und Paulaner und dann   dreht die Maske zu den aufgebahrten großen Gut und Günstig Wasserflaschen. Medium. Classic. Naturell. Schauen. Sehen. Abwägen. Denken.

Für fünfzehn Cent pro Flasche, plus zehn Cent Pfand, erlöst sich dieser große, graue Konsument von seiner Suche.Das Weinregal bietet weitere Flaschen aber keine Antworten. An der Kasse klammert sich nur noch eine Synodyne Zahncreme an die sechs roten Punkte des Mineralwassers.

    "snippet": "  If these mountains can’t stop us now, your walls won’t stop us either. We have come this far. We will always find ways.  public link de  public link enI spent six weeks at a central node of the European Union’s external borders - just six weeks, just minimal insights. While there, I worked with a group of activists in a form of political activism to support people on their journey to Europe. Some of my thoughts during this time are summarized here.The texts gathered here were written in the fall to winter of 2021 and were published sequentially in a signal group and were adapted from German with the help of DeepL. These texts make an attempt to be as concrete as possible and at the same time are quite vague in some places. Work at the EU external borders is often criminalized and takes place under restrictive publicity. Since my reporting took place without consent of those whose trust I depended on, I have decided not to mention real names.Activist work at EU external borders is based on people who join in and support it financially as well as with their own muscle power. Right now, we collect donations to get  through the winter. If you want to support this work, feel free to send me an email.Finally: In one place in particular, concrete violence against people is described. I think that we should not close our eyes to this. However, I would like to point it out because people who have been subjected to racist police violence in the past can  be retraumatized with such descriptions.The UnaIn the past two weeks, the Una had been carrying a lot of water. Coming from Croatia, the river flows through the small town of Bihać in Bosnia and Herzegovina and forms the border with the European Union in some places.Thus, the Una flows exactly the other way than most people who want to go towards Croatia and later Italy or Germany. And this is not only true for people passing through. Many of the Bosnians I meet here speak German. They speak a few words of German at the falafel snack bar, in the supermarket, at the wholesaler.The city of Bihać is small, according to Wikipedia 60,000 inhabitants. But the vast, sprawling hinterland must have been included for this count. Because around a short pedestrian zone with seven stores lays a circular one-way street, like a very large roundabout. And around it stray mixed industrial and residential areas up into the surrounding hills which frame the town.The signs of the war in the 90s can be read on many houses. Bullet holes, shell splinters. And then there are new housing estates, where little palaces stand as if from a catalog, with gravel driveways in all directions and dark blinds.I explore this scenery on foot during the day and often by car after dark. After a while, I know the different ways to prepare borek - different depending on the bakery - and I can pronounce out a broken »hvala« in thanks when a steaming borek is handed to me.Gray areaReporting on our activities here on the ground is part of a gray area. Unlike the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, organizations in the canton of Una Sana need government permission to provide humanitarian aid. We do not have this, and thus our activities here are criminalized and take place in secret, in the dark and with very selective publicity.Among other activities, we distribute food and clothing, as well as sleeping bags and tents to People on the Move¹. The handovers take place in the dark. We drive cars to designated places, meet people there with headlights turned off and hidden behind bushes to hand them oil, flour, potatoes, milk, tea, and a few spices.We are doing quite well with this strategy of little contact with the police. Another local group is regularly busted by the police during similar handovers. Usually nothing much happens. We could be expelled from the country at most. But our strategy is to ensure the longevity of the project.As I write this, I think of a young man who lives in one of the shacks around town with a group of about 20 people. He points to the hills behind Bihać, in the direction of Croatia and describes to me the course of the border. From the town you can see a swath eating its way through the forest and up the hills in the distance. The young man says that there the border is fortified with barbed wire, guards sit on watchtowers. But in most other places it is not like that: a green border, where you don’t even notice that you have crossed it.I ask the young man if a wall will soon close the border. He grins, his eyes sparkle and his gaze falls on the mountains. »Look, if these mountains can’t stop us now, your walls won’t stop us either. We’ve come this far. We will always find ways.«In the Bihać region, it is mostly young men traveling alone who get stuck. In the neighboring region of Velika Kladuša, families also strand. And in both regions, I hear solely of Afghans and Pakistanis. I know of a few Indian Kashmiris.During one of these nightly handovers, I briefly consult with my colleague in German. One of the men around our car intervenes — in fluent German. Once before, he had taken the long journey, lived in Germany for five years, worked in temporary jobs, illegalized, lived on the streets and in doorways. And when two more family members were killed in Afghanistan in early 2021, he returned to care for his mother, he said. And since the Taliban took over the country in August, he had to leave again, already branded a traitor. Now he is back on the same path, living rough in darkness and cold.It is important to understand that whatever we do here will change to change this situation. However, it is the most concrete form of solidarity that we can show. For me it is the only way to say: we care about what happens at these borders. Because I believe that it is the small groups and individual contacts that convey solidarity. The conversations at the car, in shelters, in between. The being on time at the handover, being able to rely.¹: People on the Move (PoM) is often used in activist and academic contexts as a term for people who migrate for various reasons, seeking a better life.CricketYesterday, I ended up at my first cricket match. I now know you score points and that Australia just won the championship and that Pakistan was unfortunately eliminated in the semi-finals and that it is amazingly hard to hit this ball with the piece of wood used as a bat here. It was such a pleasure to watch these 20 or so people play, enjoy the sun and watch everyone seem unworried for the moment.Unfortunately, however, it has been raining cats and dogs since yesterday. The whole Jungle, that is an area where many People on the Move stay in shacks and tents, is under water. Usually we bring 500 liters of drinking water to the Jungle four times a week and fill them into tanks. But today one area was completely flooded and one was not passable because of the mud. Only at one we could balance to the tanks.UmidOn a tour through the Jungle I met Umid last week. He is originally from the Herat region, which has been particularly terrorized by the Taliban. He left this homeland 12 years ago. The 22-year-old has now been in Bihać for three months. In between, he was stranded for a longer time in Iran, then in Turkey.I asked him if his family would continue to support him out of Afghanistan. He began a hesitant smile, almost ashamed, and explained that he no longer has a family. The most important person to him, he said, is his girlfriend, who has just started studying in Tehran. We can talk a bit in Persian (me) and Dari (him). He laughs a lot, wears a hairstyle very similar to mine, has a friendly, open face and I met him because he was just leaving for the border.It is thus time to report what I have learned so far about this border. These remain fragments of a fluid truth that I have pieced together from conversations with volunteers here and with People on the Move.Those who are here from Afghanistan or Pakistan say that the deadliest border is the one to Iran. But the most difficult is the one into the European Union. Those who want a close path to the green border come to Bihać. Whoever comes to Bihać can be stranded here until it goes further. Because where should it go back to?The way forward is calle »the Game«. The word is the one People on the Move use for the arduous struggle to get into th EU. Who is playing against whom, whether it will ever become clear what the rules of this game are, and whether there is any kind of game here at all, is not clear to me. But very slowly I develop an understanding of the choice of words.There are people who have been in Bihać for two years and have already gone on Game thirty or even forty times. There are different types of games, from »walking game« and »truck game« to »half-taxi game« and »full-taxi game«. Who  organizes these games is not clear to me. What is certain is that the different types of games cost different amounts. From the cheapest walking game I’ve heard of for 80 euros, to a full-taxi game that has cost 15,000 euros.In early November, an international human smuggling ring that had its hub in Bihać was busted by a cooperation of Spanish, Croatian, and Bosnian police units. I only learned about this from the newspapers.With the winter getting worse, the walking game, where people try to walk 300 kilometers from Bihać to Italy in about 14 days, is getting harder. Just last week, I spoke with a group who were caught by border police right at the first road into Croatia because their tracks in the snow could be seen from a distance by patrolling drones.Umid tried his hand at truck-game that day last week. In the process, he tried to jump on a truck that had just passed the human-scanner at the Croatian border with destination Italy. For the trip, travelers have to hold on or chain themselves for hours -  to avoid falling off because of tiredness. I met Umid again last night at a food handover. Truck game didn’t work out. He chuckled too, but it was his third try. Since he has no way to get more money, truck game remains the only option according to him.It is important to understand that we meet all these people again after Game because they were pushed back to Bosnia by Croatian or Slovenian or Italian border guards. This practice of pushbacks is illegal and takes place systematically. Last week, both the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe Anti-Torture Committee condemned these acts.I’ve been wondering for a while what it means that pushbacks are systematic. Is there a logic to who is being pushbacked? A system by which pushbacks are organized?So far, it seems to me that the simplest description is that pushbacks are simply a flexible and hidden form of a fortified border. Instead of a visible and rigid system, drones, dogs, thermal imaging cameras, and officials capture these people, round them up, usually take their shoes and cell phones, and then put them on Croatian buses waiting on the arterial roads just beyond the border. Then these buses drive from the Croatian side into the Bosnian forests, on roads that have been built as dead ends specifically for this purpose. At the border, everyone has to get off, line up, and then they are driven into the forest towards Bosnia with kicks and baton blows until the dogs are let loose. We keep seeing injuries on the chest or legs from pushbacks.This is how the situation is currently described to us. Some who have been going to on Game for years say that the violence has decreased since the ARD reporting of early October 2021. However, we still hear of border police beating people.The latest twist by Croatian border guards is that cell phones are no longer kept, but simply sim card slots and connectors destroyed. I imagine a Croatian border police station where the working cell phones of previous pushbacks are piled up and someone said that this is now slowly too much, whether there is not a more efficient solution. And the border mechanism always finds new, efficient defense strategies.For us as a European society, it is therefore important to understand that the right to asylum simply no longer exists. We have said goodbye to the original Western ideals of a free and open society not only in the concrete policing of the borders, but also by condoning and looking away from the border fortifications.Umid is not the only pushback we provided with clothing and food yesterday. Every day we have about 3 to 5 pushback groups and therefore always have a box of emergency clothes to hand out. Now we have run out of shoes in sizes 41 to 44 and unfortunately we have to apologize for not being able to help out with that.So how do I conclude a text that looks so abstractly at this pathetic situation? How do I dismiss readers who have read this far in such a way that I do justice to the responsibility for my half-knowledge and in such a way that the problems, crises, and tragedies of your - the readers’ - realities also retain their drift?I use words that have been brought to us here, that carry me forward. Our project is accompanied by a psychologist from Germany. To a brief hint of despair from our group, she said, »Hopelessness is a luxury we cannot afford.« I bow to the hope that people here carry. Our society could only benefit from it.IsolationThis morning I left Bihać. On my journey home, I am accompanied by a suitcase that can no longer be closed, bulging with impressions that are still diffuse. Two of these aspects I would like to share briefly before I hopefully do not do much else in the coming days except sleep and cuddle.Our group came to Bihać in 2021 to help out in an acute emergency. At the end of 2020, the official camp for migrants in the region had burned down and in the confusion of organizations and official bodies, all care for people went down the drain.A few weeks ago, the new camp »Lipa« (Bosnian for lime tree) opened and since then I have been struggling with what to say about it. Of the people I meet in shacks around Bihać, no one wants to go to the camp. They say the food supply is poor, the infrastructure is dilapidated, and who would even want to live in a camp where every movement is surveilled.The new camp is hidden in Una National Park about 25 minutes by car from Bihać; hidden in a small patch of forest in the wide sprawling National Park. Hidden in the sense that we simply did not find it once during the day. No signs point to it and we must have just walked past it.When it gets dark, however, it’s hard to miss. Because then floodlights drench the sky above the camp in a bright glow, the surrounding snow reflects the light and it seems as if a UFO hovers in the middle of the forest.From a small hill, we can glance over the clearing and behind the fence we, make out the clinically lined up housing containers and somewhere we see a silhouette piercing footsteps into the snow.I hardly know anything about the circumstances in the camp, it’s just my gaze falling on these straight, cold, white facilities, a constant hum of a heater or generator, the floodlights framing the scenery unreal.And I cannot help but think of science-fiction movies that try to capture the humanitarian crises of our future. I think of the movie Children of Men and the cold aesthetics of military organization of battered people.But these humanitarian crises of our future are already here. Just not at our doorstep. And in the future, too, these crises will take place far away from our porches. The New Yorker reported last week on how the European Union has been trying to make migration invisible for several years. It described how the EU has been systematically funding and equipping torture prisons in Libya since 2015.I try to write against this invisibility. Because I want to encourage people not to understand migration as an abstract phenomenon of arriving people. In contrast, I think it is a militarized defence mechanism pointed at individuals using brute force. Against people who have families and dreams and who could give us all hope. If we let them.A second piece of luggage protrudes from my travel bag. It is the confrontation with the group of people with whom I had the privilege to work, live, mourn and dance in Bihać.Those who join our group come to Bosnia for six weeks to three months, live together, eat together, work together, and sometimes enjoy spending free time together. We finance our stay here entirely ourselves. All money the group receives through donations or grants funds our work.My first instinct was to write about how not everyone can afford such a time. That one must have the necessary money left over for it. However, in Bihać I did not meet a privileged bunch of affluent young hippies who spend the rest of their money on a self-exploration trip. On the contrary, I met young, serious people who, coming from variously precarious or discriminated perspectives, simply go to work in Germany and earn money so that they can afford activism at the border.It seems to me, that my privileged position in most dimensions of suppression, not least that of wealth, makes me an outlier to this group. For me, therefore, the main question was how I could take the time to come to Bihać for several weeks. I was unsure how I could fit this into my life and such a thing as career. But, my educational background and my family background - apart from unforeseeable accidents - will save me existential fears forever. With this in mind, why didn’t I pursue such work  more emphatically in the past?We are leaving Bihać today and only a handful of persevering, cheerful and active people remain in Bihać. With that, I leave this place with the recurring insight of how care work works: That once again it’s the punks, the outlaws, the quiet and the underdogs who stand the ground.Among those who try to carry a spark of solidarity in Bihać, no one seems to me to aspire to a secure, well-paid profession, no one seems to me to prefer the security of a bourgeois life to the attempted defense of freedom of mind. Therefore, I would like to retain with courage. For we can all use courage to face the crises of the future.EpilogueI sit in a spa in Cologne - already vaccinated for the third time - rubbing honey into my hair and skin. I think about how this state takes care of me.Returning home always is a reality shock. I am glad to have already written most of it out of my brain in the past weeks. So I’ll wrap up this series here with some thoughts.I’ve been asked how I came to go to our borders, join this group. The short story is that fortunately I have some people in my life who have done this kind of work over the years. In Lesbos, in Calais, in Ventimiglia, and of course in Germany. So people have always told me the stories I have told here, each in their subjective forms. And with that I had a special person who encouraged me to come along in autumn 2021. Many thanks go to CY for your forbearance, perseverance and serenity.Also, I admire the song »Summer of ‘89« by the German band Kettcar. It is about an escape agent who helped German refugees leave the former German Democratic Republic to live in West-Germany. Two of the song’s passages remain important to me.First, it is the description of gratitude. I was downright embarrassed when people on the move, in the cold thanked me for a single sack of firewood, for some cooking oil or a pound of flour. I hope that I keep these words humming in my ears as a reminder to humility for a long time.Second, the last verse of the song sounds differently to me now. In it, Kettcar describe what they call a »on the one hand, on the other hand discussion«; a debate that erupts in a shared apartment after the escape agent’s return, that the his action is understandable from a humanitarian perspective, but must be questioned in a geopolitical context: The apparent contradiction between concrete plight and abstract consideration.In relation to my time in Bihać, it would be the discussion that on the one hand it is good to help these people in their with their concrete needs, but on the other hand not everyone can be helped anyway, Germany cannot take in everyone or that this work in Bosnia does not solve the problem permanently.I hear this verse now anew, because I would point out that concrete emergency and abstract consideration are just no contradiction. Even if abstract arguments of the on the other hand argumentation are correct (obviously this work in Bosnia does not solve the problem), their juxtaposition to the on the other hand argumentation not only obscures the plight of people in Bosnia or elsewhere. It also obscures the abandonment of human rights principles. Thus, at the European external borders it is not about helping others, but about »our freedom of mind« (as the wonderful band HörZu put it). Thus, this »on the one hand, on the other hand«-discussion is not a juxtaposition of contradicts, but rather a delegitimization of human rights activist work.However, the argumentative juxtaposition reveals another point: the connection between the concrete, i.e. micro-economic situation of people and their possible plight and an abstract, i.e. macro-economic view of the world.It is one thing to read in the newspaper about gangs of smugglers and dead people in vans locked up by smugglers and then get upset about it. Because the portrayal remains mostly abstract, blame can be apportioned in a linear fashion.It’s something else to see the shining eyes of someone who can finally afford Taxi-Game and thus hopes to be more likely to get into the EU. Of course, the delivery trucks we read about in the papers every now and then are the cabs in this game.Perhaps also due to my macro-economic, abstract education of the past years, I had lost sight of the concrete, the micro perspective. I now know that every donated powerbank, every donated pair of shoes, and every donated sleeping bag makes a difference. Of course, this donation does not make the suffering of migration disappear into thin air, but at least a person can have warm feet while sending a sign of life to family 6000 kilometers away.This is not meant to be a call for donations or tear-jerking, but merely an observation that it is possible to make a difference.PS: Naika Foroutan argues at Der Spiegel why migration is not a problem.PPS: As described at the beginning: This work is in need of support. If you want to do so, feel free to send me an email. I am also grateful for suggestions, criticism and comments via this email."

    "snippet": "  Wenn uns jetzt diese Berge nicht aufhalten können, werden uns eure Mauern auch nicht aufhalten. Wir sind so weit gekommen. Wir werden immer Wege finden.  public link de  public link enIch habe sechs Wochen an einem Knotenpunkt der Europäischen Außengrenzen verbracht — nur sechs Wochen, nur minimale Einblicke. Dabei habe ich mit einer Gruppe an Mitstreiter:innen in einer Form von politischem Aktivismus Menschen auf ihrer Reise in die Europäischen Union unterstützt. Einige meiner Gedanken während dieser Zeit sind hier zusammengefasst.Die hier versammelten Texte sind im Herbst bis Winter 2021 entstanden und wurden sequenziell in einer Signal-Gruppe veröffentlicht. Diese Texte machen den Versuch so konkret wie möglich zu sein und sind gleichzeitig an einigen Stellen recht vage. Arbeit an den Europäischen Außengrenzen wird häufig kriminalisiert und findet unter restriktiver Öffentlichkeitsarbeit statt. Da meine Berichte hier nicht mit den Menschen abgesprochen sind, unter deren Vertrauen sie entstanden sind, habe ich mich dazu entschlossen an keiner Stelle echte Namen zu nennen.Diese Arbeit basiert darauf, dass sich Menschen ihr anschließen und diese Arbeit finanziell wie auch mit eigener Muskelkraft unterstützen. Akut sammeln wir Spenden, um vor Ort besser durch den Winter zu kommen. Falls du diese Arbeit unterstützen möchtest, schreib mir gerne eine E-Mail.Schlußendlich: An insbesondere einer Stelle wird konkrete Gewalt gegen Menschen beschrieben. Ich denke, dass wir davor die Augen nicht verschließen sollten. Dennoch möchte ich darauf hinweisen, da Menschen, die rassistischer Polizei-Gewalt in der Vergangenheit ausgesetzt waren, auch durch solche Beschreibungen retraumatisiert werden können.Die UnaIn den vergangenen zwei Wochen hatte die Una sehr viel Wasser geführt. Von Kroatien her fließt der Fluss durch die Kleinstadt Bihać in Bosnien und Herzegowina und bildet an vielen Stellen die Grenze zur Europäischen Union.Die Una fließt also genau anders herum als die meisten Menschen, die Richtung Kroatien und später Italien oder Deutschland wollen. Und das gilt nicht nur für Menschen auf der Durchreise. Viele der Bosnier:innen, die ich hier treffe, sprechen Deutsch. Beim Falafel-Imbiss ein paar Worte Badisch, im Supermarkt, beim Großhändler.Die Stadt Bihać ist klein, laut Wikipedia 60.000 Einwohner:innen. Aber es muss wohl das weite, zersiedelte Hinterland miteinbezogen worden sein, um auf diese Zahl zu kommen. Denn um ein kleines Zentrum, das aus einer kurzen Fußgängerzone mit sieben Geschäften besteht, legt sich eine kreisförmige Einbahnstraße, wie ein sehr großer Kreisverkehr und drum herum ziehen sich vermischt Industrie- und Wohngebiete bis hinauf in die umliegenden Hügel, die den Ort vorerst einrahmen.Die Zeichen des Krieges in den 90er Jahren sind an vielen Hauswänden abzulesen. Einschusslöcher, Granatsplitter. Und dann gibt es Neubausiedlungen, in denen geradezu Paläste wie aus dem Katalog stehen, mit Kiesauffahrt in alle Richtungen und dunklen Jalousien. Just so, wie sie in einer badischen Kleinstadt stehen könnten.Diese Szenerie erkunde ich untertags zu Fuß und häufig nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit mit dem Auto. Nach einer Weile kenne ich die verschiedenen Arten Börek zuzubereiten — je nach Bäckerei verschieden — und ich kann ein gebrochenes »hvala« zum Dank herausbringen, wenn mir ein dampfender Börek überreicht wird.GrauzoneUm von unserer Tätigkeit hier vor Ort zu berichten, begebe ich mich in eine gewisse Grauzone. Denn — anders als im Rest von Bosnien und Herzegowina — brauchen Organisationen im Kanton Una Sana eine staatliche Erlaubnis, um humanitäre Hilfe leisten zu dürfen. Wir haben diese nicht und damit ist unsere Tätigkeit hier kriminalisiert und findet im Verborgenen, im Dunkeln und unter sehr ausgewählter Öffentlichkeitsarbeit statt.Neben anderen Tätigkeiten verteilen wir hier Essen und Kleidung, sowie Schlafsäcke und Zelte and People on the Move¹. Die Übergaben finden im Dunkeln statt. Wir fahren mit Autos an ausgemachte Orte, treffen dort mit ausgeschalteten Scheinwerfern und hinter Büschen versteckt Menschen, um ihnen Öl, Mehl, Kartoffeln, Milch, Tee und ein paar Gewürze zu übergeben.Wir fahren bisher recht gut mit der Strategie möglichst keinen Kontakt mit der Polizei zu haben. Eine andere Gruppe vor Ort wird regelmäßig bei ähnlichen Übergaben von der Polizei hochgenommen. In der Regel passiert auch nicht viel, wir könnten höchstens des Landes verwiesen werden. Aber unsere Strategie soll die Langfristigkeit des Projekts sichern.Während ich das schreibe, denke ich an einen jungen Mann, der in einer der Baraken um die Stadt mit einer Gruppe von etwa 20 Personen wohnt. Er zeigt auf die Hügel hinter Bihać, in Richtung Kroatien und beschreibt mir den Grenzverlauf. Denn von der Stadt aus sieht man eine Schneise, die sich in der Ferne durch den Wald und die Hügel hinauf frisst. Der junge Mann sagt, dass an der Stelle die Grenze mit Stacheldraht befestigt sei, Wachen auf Wachtürmen säßen. Aber an den meisten anderen Stellen sei das nicht so: Eine grüne Grenze, bei der man nicht einmal merkt sie übertreten zu haben.Ich frage den jungen Mann, ob nicht bald auch hier eine Mauer kommen wird, um die Grenze zu schließen. Er grinst, in seinen Augen funkelt es und sein Blick fällt auf die Berge. »Schau, wenn uns jetzt diese Berge nicht aufhalten können, werden uns eure Mauern auch nicht aufhalten. Wir sind so weit gekommen. Wir werden immer Wege finden.«In der Region Bihać straucheln besonders häufig alleinreisende junge Männer. In der Nachbarregion Velika Kladuša stranden auch Familien. Und in beiden Regionen höre ich fast ausschließlich von Afghan:innen und Pakistanis. Ich weiß von einigen indischen Kashmiris.Bei einer dieser nächtlichen Essensübergaben konsultiere ich kurz mit meiner Kollegin auf Deutsch. Einer der Männer um unser Auto schaltet sich ein, auf fließendem Deutsch. Schon einmal hätte er die lange Reise auf sich genommen, fünf Jahre in Deutschland gelebt, in Aushilfsjobs gearbeitet, illegalisiert, auf der Straße und in Hauseingängen gewohnt. Und als Anfang 2021 zwei weitere Familienmitglieder in Afghanistan ums Leben kamen, sei er zurück, um seine Mutter zu pflegen. Und seit im August die Taliban das Land übernommen haben, musste er wieder weg, schon als Verräter gebrandmarkt. Jetzt ist er wieder auf dem selben Weg, harrt in Dunkelheit und Kälte aus.Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass was auch immer wir hier tun diesen Schicksalen kaum Änderung ihrer Lage ermöglichen wird. Es ist jedoch die konkreteste Form der Solidarität, die wir zeigen können. Es bleibt für mich die einzige Möglichkeit zu sagen: Es ist uns nicht egal was an diesen Grenzen passiert. Denn ich glaube, dass es die kleinen Gruppen und individuellen Kontakte sind, die Solidarität vermitteln. Die Gespräche am Auto, in Behausungen, zwischendurch. Das pünktlich bei der Übergabe sein, sich verlassen können.¹: People on the Move (PoM) wird häufig in aktivistischen und akademischen Zusammenhängen als Bezeichnung für Menschen verwendet, die aus verschiedenen Gründen unterwegs sind, um ein besseres Leben zu suchen.CricketGestern bin ich zufällig bei meinem ersten Cricket-Spiel gelandet. Ich weiß jetzt, man da Punkte sammelt und, dass Australien gerade erst die Meisterschaft gewonnen hat und, dass Pakistan leider im Halbfinale ausgeschieden ist und, dass es erstaunlich schwer ist diesen Ball mit dem Stück Holz zu treffen, das hier als Schläger verwendet wird. Es war mir eine so große Freude, diese etwa 20 Menschen beim Spiel zu beobachten, die Sonne zu genießen und zuzusehen, wie alle für den Moment sorglos zu sein scheinen.Leider regnet es jedoch seit gestern in Strömen. Der ganze Jungle, also ein Areal auf dem viele People on the Move in Baraken und Zelten verweilen, steht unter Wasser. Eigentlich bringen wir vier Mal die Woche 500 Liter Trinkwasser in den Jungle und füllen diese in Tanks. Aber heute war ein Areal komplett überschwemmt und eines wegen dem Matsch nicht befahrbar. Nur an einem konnten wir über Tritte zu den Tanks balancieren.UmidAuf einer Tour durch den Jungle traf ich vergangene Woche Umid. Er kommt ursprünglich aus der von der Taliban besonders terrorisierten Region Herat. Vor 12 Jahren hat er diese Heimat verlassen. Seit drei Monaten ist der 22-Jährige nun in Bihać. Zwischendurch war er länger in Iran, dann in der Türkei gestrandet.Ich fragte ihn, ob seine Familie ihn weiter aus Afghanistan heraus unterstützt. Er begann ein zögerliches Lächeln, fast beschämt und erklärte, dass er keine Familie mehr hat. Der wichtigste Mensch für ihn sei seine Freundin, die gerade erst in Teheran ein Studium aufgenommen hat. Wir können uns rudimentär auf Persisch beziehungsweise Dari unterhalten, er lacht viel, trägt eine sehr ähnliche Frisur wie ich, hat ein freundliches, offenes Gesicht und ich traf ihn, weil er sich gerade aufmachte Richtung Grenze.Es ist damit an der Zeit zu berichten, was ich bisher über diese Grenze gelernt habe. Dies bleiben Bruchstücke einer fluiden Wahrheit, die ich mir aus dem Versatz von Gesprächen mit Freiwilligen hier vor Ort und mit People on the Move zusammen gereimt habe.Wer aus Afghanistan oder Pakistan hier ist, berichtet, dass die tödlichste Grenze die nach Iran ist. Aber die schwierigste die in die Europäische Union. Nach Bihać kommt, wer einen nahen Weg zur grünen Grenze will. Wer nach Bihać kommt, kann hier stranden, bis es weiter geht. Denn wohin sollte es zurück gehen?Der Weg vorwärts ist das »Game«. Das Wort ist dasjenige, das People on the Move verwenden, wenn sie den Schritt von Bihać in die EU benennen. Wer hier gegen wen spielt, ob jemals klar wird, nach welchen Regeln dieses Spiel abläuft und ob hier überhaupt eine Art Spiel vorliegt, ist mir nicht ersichtlich. Aber ganz langsam entwickle ich ein Verständnis für die Wortwahl.Es gibt Menschen, die seit zwei Jahren in Bihać sind und bereits dreißig oder sogar vierzig Mal auf’s Game gegangen sind. Es gibt verschiedene Spielarten, von »walking game« und »truck game« bis »half-taxi game« und »full-taxi game«. Wer genau diese Games organisiert, ist mir nicht ersichtlich. Sicher ist jedenfalls, dass die unterschiedlichen Game-Arten unterschiedlich kosten. Von dem günstigsten walking game von dem ich schon für 80 Euro gehört habe, bis zu einem full-taxi game, das auch schon 15.000 Euro gekostet hat.Anfang November wurde ein internationaler Menschenschmuggelring, der seine Drehscheibe in Bihać hatte, durch eine Kooperation spanischer, kroatischer und bosnischer Polizeieinheiten ausgehoben. Ich habe davon lediglich aus der Zeitung erfahren. Von Menschen hier vor Ort habe ich diesbezüglich nichts gehört.Mit dem sich verschärfenden Winter, wird das walking game, bei dem Menschen von Bihać in etwa 14 Tagen 300 Kilometer zu Fuß bis nach Italien zurückzulegen versuchen, immer schwerer. Erst vergangene Woche habe ich mit einer Gruppe gesprochen, die direkt an der ersten Straße in Kroatien von der Grenzpolizei gefasst wurden, weil ihre Spuren im Schnee schon aus der Ferne durch patrouillierende Drohnen zu sehen waren.Umid versuchte sich an dem Tag in der vergangenen Woche am truck-game. Dabei versuchte er auf einen Lastwagen zu springen, der mit Fahrtziel Italien gerade den Menschenscanner an der kroatischen Grenze passiert hat. Für die Fahrt müssen sich die Reisenden stundenlang festhalten oder ketten sich an — auch, um wegen Übermüdung nicht zu stürzen. Ich habe Umid gestern Abend bei einer Essensverteilung wieder getroffen. Truck game hat nicht geklappt. Er hat auch gekichert, aber es war sein dritter Versuch. Da er keine Möglichkeit hat, an weiteres Geld zu kommen, bleibt truck game nach seiner Beschreibung die einzige Option.Wichtig zu verstehen ist, dass wir all diese Menschen nach dem Game wieder treffen, weil sie von kroatischen oder slowenischen oder italienischen Grenzbeamten zurück nach Bosnien geschoben wurden. Diese Praxis der Pushbacks ist illegal und findet systematisch statt. In der vergangenen Woche hatten sowohl der Europäische Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte als auch das Anti-Folter-Komitee des Europarats diese Handlungen verurteilt.Ich habe mich eine Weile gefragt, was es bedeutet, dass Pushbacks  systematisch stattfinden. Gibt es eine Logik, wer gepushbacked wird? Ein System, mit dem Pushbacks organisiert werden?Bisher scheint mir die simpelste Beschreibung zu sein, dass Pushbacks schlicht eine flexible und verborgene Form der befestigten Grenze sind. Anstelle einer sichtbaren und starren Anlage fangen Drohnen, Hunde, Wärmebildkameras und Beamte diese Menschen ein, treiben sie zusammen, nehmen ihnen in der Regel ihre Schuhe und Handys ab und stecken sie dann in die an den Ausfallstraßen direkt hinter der Grenze bereitstehenden kroatischen Busse. Dann fahren diese Busse von der kroatischen Seite in die bosnischen Wälder, auf Straßen, die als Sackgassen eigens für diesen Zweck errichtet wurden. Auf der Grenze müssen alle aussteigen, sich in einer Reihe aufstellen und werden dann mit Tritten und Tonfa-Schlägen in den Wald Richtung Bosnien getrieben, bis die Hunde losgelassen werden. Wir sehen immer wieder entsprechende Verletzungen an Brust oder Beinen.So wird uns die Situation derzeit geschildert, obwohl einige, die schon seit Jahren aufs Game gehen, berichten, dass die Gewalt seit der ARD-Berichterstattung von Anfang Oktober 2021 zurück gegangen sei. Von prügelnden Grenzpolizisten hören wir dennoch.Der neueste Twist kroatischer Grenzbeamter ist, dass Handys nicht mehr einbehalten werden, sondern schlicht Sim-Karten-Schlitze und Anschlüsse zerstört werden. Ich stelle mir eine kroatische Grenzpolizeistation vor, in der sich die funktionstüchtigen Handys früherer Pushbacks stapeln und jemand meinte, das sei nun langsam zu viel, ob es da nicht eine effizientere Lösung gäbe. Und der Grenzmechanismus findet immer neue, effiziente Abwehrstrategien.Für uns als europäische Gesellschaft ist daher wichtig zu verstehen, dass das Recht auf Asyl schlichtweg nicht mehr existiert. Wir haben uns nicht nur in der konkreten Polizeiarbeit an den Grenzen, sondern auch durch das Dulden und Wegsehen der Grenzbefestigungen von den ursprünglich westlichen Idealen einer freien und offenen Gesellschaft verabschiedet.Umid ist nicht der einzige Pushback, den wir gestern mit Kleidung und Essen versorgten. Jeden Tag haben wir etwa 3 bis 5 Pushback-Gruppen und daher immer eine Kiste mit Notfallklamotten dabei, die wir ausgeben können. Nun sind uns die Schuhe in den Größen zwischen 41 und 44 ausgegangen und wir müssen uns leider entschuldigen, damit nicht aushelfen zu können.Wie schließe ich nun einen solchen Text ab, der so abstrakt auf diese erbärmliche Situation blickt? Wie entlasse ich diejenigen, die bis hier gelesen haben so, dass ich der Verantwortung für mein Halbwissen gerecht werde und so, dass auch die Probleme, Krisen und Tragiken eurer — der Lesenden — Realitäten ihren Gehalt behalten, ihre umfassende Dimension nicht einbüßen? Und wie schließe ich einen Text, ohne einen deplatziert romantisierenden Bogen zu schlagen?Ich entscheide mich für Worte, die uns hier zugetragen worden sind, die uns weiter tragen. Unser Projekt wird von einer Psychologin aus Deutschland begleitet. Zu einem kurzen Anflug von Verzweiflung aus unserer Gruppe meinte sie: »Hoffnungslosigkeit ist ein Luxus, den wir uns nicht leisten können.« Ich verneige mich vor der Hoffnung, die mir Menschen hier entgegentragen. Unsere Gesellschaft könnte davon nur profitieren.IsolationHeute morgen habe ich Bihać verlassen. Auf meiner Heimreise begleitet mich eine nicht mehr schließbare Reisetasche, prall gefüllt mit noch diffusen Eindrücken und dem, was allgemein Lebenserfahrung genannt wird. Zwei dieser Aspekte möchte ich noch kurz teilen, bevor ich in den kommenden Tagen hoffentlich außer Schlafen und Kuscheln nicht viel anderes mache.Unsere Gruppe 2021nach Bihać gekommen, um in der akuten Notlage auszuhelfen. Ende 2020 war das offizielle Lager für Migrant:innen in der Region abgebrannt und im Durcheinander der Organisationen und offiziellen Stellen ging jegliche Versorgung der Menschen vor Ort den Bach hinunter.Vor einigen Wochen wurde das neue Camp »Lipa« (bosnisch für Linde) eröffnet und seither trage ich mich mit der Frage, was ich dazu sagen kann. Von den Menschen, die ich in Baraken um Bihać treffe, will niemand in das Lager. Die Essensversorgung sei schlecht, die Infrastruktur marode und wer wolle schon in einem Lager leben, in dem jede Bewegung überwacht werde.Das Lager liegt im Una Sana Nationalpark etwa 25 Autominuten von Bihać entfernt, versteckt in einem kleinen Waldstück. Versteckt in dem Sinn, dass wir es bei Tag einmal einfach nicht gefunden haben. Kein Schild weißt darauf hin und wir müssen einfach daran vorbeigelaufen sein.Wenn es dunkel wird, ist es jedoch kaum zu übersehen. Denn dann tränkt Flutlichtbeleuchtung den Himmel über dem Lager in einen hellen Schein, der umliegende Schnee reflektiert das Licht und es scheint als schwebe ein Ufo mitten im Wald.Von einer kleinen Anhöhe können wir rüberschauen, über den das Lager umgebenden Zaun, die klinisch aneinandergereihten Wohncontainer ausmachen und irgendwo sehen wir eine Silhouette auf und ab gehen.Ich weiß kaum etwas über die Umstände im Lager, es ist nur mein Blick, der auf diese geraden, kalten, weißen Anlagen fällt, ein konstantes Brummen einer Heizung oder eines Generators, das Flutlicht, das die Szenerie unwirklich einrahmt.Und ich kann nicht anders als an science-fiction Filme zu denken, die die humanitären Krisen unserer Zukunft einzufangen versuchen. Ich denke an den Film »Children of Men« und die kalte Ästhetik militärischer Organisation gebeutelter Menschen.Ich merke bloß, dass diese humanitären Krisen unserer Zukunft bereits hier sind. Nur eben nicht an unserer Haustüre. Und auch in der Zukunft werden sich diese Krisen weit weg von unseren Haustüren abspielen. Im New Yorker wurde in der vergangenen Woche berichtet, wie die Europäische Union seit einigen Jahren versucht, Migration unsichtbar zu machen. Beschrieben wurde, wie die EU seit 2015 systematisch Foltergefängnisse in Libyen finanziert und ausstattet.Gegen diese Unsichtbarkeit versuche ich anzuschreiben. Denn ich möchte Mut machen Migration nicht als ein abstraktes Phänomen ankommender Menschen zu verstehen. Ich schlage dagegen eine Betrachtung vor, bei der sich ein militarisierter Verteidigungsmechanismus mit konkreter Gewalt gegen einzelne Menschen richtet. Gegen Menschen, die Familien und Träume haben und die uns allen Hoffnung spenden könnten. Wenn wir sie ließen.Ein zweites Gepäckstück ragt noch aus meiner Reisetasche hervor. Es ist die Auseinandersetzung mit der Gruppe an Menschen, mit denen ich in Bihać arbeiten, wohnen, trauern und tanzen durfte.Diejenigen, die sich unserer Gruppe anschließen, kommen für sechs Wochen bis drei Monate nach Bosnien, wohnen gemeinsam, essen gemeinsam, arbeiten gemeinsam und verbringen auch gerne mal Freizeit gemeinsam. Wir finanzieren unseren Aufenthalt hier vollständig selbst. Sämtliche Gelder, die die Gruppe über Spenden oder Fördergelder erhält, fließen in die Arbeit.Fast hätte ich nun dem Reflex gefolgt zu schreiben, dass sich nicht jede:r eine solche Zeit leisten kann. Dass man das nötige Geld dafür übrig haben müsse. Der Punkt ist jedoch, dass ich in Bihać keinen privilegierten Haufen wohlstandsverzogener junger Hippies kennen gelernt habe, die ihr übriges Geld in einen Selbsterfahrungstrip stecken. Im Gegenteil habe ich hier junge, ernste Menschen kennen gelernt, die aus verschiedentlich prekär oder diskriminierten Perspektiven heraus schlichtweg in Deutschland arbeiten gehen und Geld verdienen, damit sie den Aktivismus an der Grenze leisten können.Mit meiner luxuriösen finanziellen Ausstattung bin ich hier sicherlich eher ein Sonderfall. Für mich stand daher die Frage im Vordergrund, wie ich mir die Zeit nehmen könnte, um für mehrere Wochen nach Bihać zu kommen. Denn wie kann das mit Berufsleben oder Karriere vereinbart werden? Dabei wird mir ein bisheriger Ausbildungsweg und mein familiärer Hintergrund — abseits unvorhersehbarer Unfälle — existentielle Ängste für immer ersparen. Vor diesem Hintergrund verbleibt für mich die Frage, wie ich solche Arbeit wie in Bihać nicht bereits nachdrücklicher in der Vergangenheit verfolgen konnte.Nun reisen wir also ab und es verbleiben nur noch eine Hand voll ausdauernde, fröhliche und anpackende Menschen in Bihać. Damit verlasse ich diesen Ort in der wiederkehrenden Einsicht, wie sich Sorgearbeit weltweit verhält: Dass es mal wieder die Punks, die Alternativen, die ruhigen und die Underdogs sind, die die Stellung halten.Unter denen, die in Bihać versuchen einen Funken Solidarität weiter zu tragen, scheint mir niemand nach einem sicheren, wohlbezahlten Beruf zu streben, scheint mir niemand die Sicherheit eines bürgerlichen Lebens der versuchten Verteidigung unseres freiheitlichen Lebens vorzuziehen. Daher möchte ich auch hiermit Mut machen. Denn wir können alle Mut gebrauchen, um uns den Krisen, die da weiter kommen werden, gemeinsam stellen zu können.EpilogIch sitze im Neptunbad in Köln-Ehrenfeld — mittlerweile zum dritten Mal geimpft — und reibe mir Honig in die Haare und die Haut. Dabei denke ich darüber nach, wie sich dieser Staat um mich kümmert.Heimkehren bedeutet ja immer einen gewissen Realitätsshock. Ich bin froh mir diesen schon in den vergangenen Wochen aus dem Hirn geschrieben zu haben. Daher versuche ich diese Serie hier mit einigen Gedanken abzuschließen.Ich wurde gefragt, wie ich dazu kam, an unsere Grenzen zu fahren, mich dieser Gruppe anzuschließen und so weiter. Die kurze Geschichte ist, dass ich glücklicherweise einige Menschen in meinem Leben habe, die solche Arbeit in den vergangenen Jahren gemacht haben. Auf Lesbos, in Calais, in Ventimiglia und natürlich in Deutschland. Somit haben mir immer wieder Leute die Geschichten, die ich hier erzählt habe, in ihren jeweils anderen subjektiven Formen berichtet. Und damit hatte ich einen besonderen Menschen, die mir Mut gemacht hat im Herbst 2021 mitzukommen. Vielen Dank an dieser Stelle an CY für deine Nachsicht, Ausdauer und Gelassenheit.Die längere Geschichte und das mag pathetisch klingen — mich hat ein Lied der Band Kettcar sehr berührt. In »Sommer ‘89« singen sie von einem Fluchthelfer, der an der österreich-ungarischen Grenze Löcher in den Grenzzaun schneidet und so einigen sächsischen Familien zur Flucht in die BRD verhilft. Zwei Passagen aus diesem Lied höre ich heute mit anderen Ohren.Zum einen die Beschreibung der Dankbarkeit. Es war mir geradezu peinlich, wenn sich flüchtende Menschen in der Kälte in Bihać bei mir für einen einzelnen Sack Feuerholz, für etwas Speiseöl oder ein Pfund Mehl bedankt haben. Ich hoffe, dass ich diese Worte noch lange in Demut weiter in meinen Ohren bewegen werde.Zum anderen höre ich heute die letzte Strophe des Liedes anders. Darin beschreiben Kettcar die »einerseits, andererseits Diskussion«; eine Debatte, die nach Rückkehr des Fluchthelfers in einer Wohngemeinschaft entbrennt, dass die Aktion des Fluchthelfers menschlich verständlich sei, aber in einem geopolitischen Kontext hinterfragt werden müsse: Der scheinbare Widerspruch zwischen konkreter Notlage und abstrakter Betrachtung.Auf meine Zeit in Bihać bezogen, wäre das die Diskussion, dass es ja einerseits gut sei diesen Menschen in ihrer konkreten Not zu helfen oder das Abschottungsregime der Europäischen Union ein Scheusal sei, aber andererseits sowieso nicht allen geholfen werden könne, Deutschland auch nicht alle aufnehmen könne oder diese Arbeit in Bosnien ja nun auch nicht das Problem (an der Wurzel) löse. Für das Andererseits können hier selbstverständlich beliebige andere abstrakte Argumente eingefügt werden.Ich höre diese Strophe nun neu, weil ich darauf verweisen würde, dass konkrete Notlage und abstrakte Betrachtung eben kein Widerspruch sind. Selbst wenn abstrakte Argumente der Andererseits-Argumentation richtig sind (offensichtlicherweise löst diese Arbeit in Bosnien nicht das Problem), verschleiert deren Gegenüberstellung zur Einerseits-Argumentation nicht nur die Notlage von Menschen in Bosnien oder anderswo. Sie verschleiert auch die Aufgabe menschenrechtlicher Prinzipien, auf die wir doch eigentlich so stolz sind. Damit geht es an den Europäischen Außengrenzen nicht um Hilfe für andere, sondern um »unseren freien Sinn« (wie es die wunderbare Band HörZu ausdrücken). Damit ist diese »einerseits, andererseits Diskussion« keine Gegenüberstellung von Widersprüchen, sondern eher eine Delegitimierung menschenrechtsaktivistischer Arbeit.Die argumentative Gegenüberstellung offenbart jedoch noch einen weiteren Punkt: Den Zusammenhang aus konkreter, das heißt mikro-ökonomischer Situation von Menschen und deren eventueller Notlage und einer abstrakten, das heißt makro-ökonomischen oder pseudo-philosophischen Betrachtung der Welt.Es ist das eine, in der Zeitung von Schleuserbanden zu lesen und Toten in Lieferwägen, die von Schleusern eingesperrt wurden und sich dann darüber aufzuregen. Da die Darstellung meist abstrakt bleibt, können Schuldzuweisungen linear verlaufen.Es ist etwas anderes, die leuchtenden Augen eines Menschen zu sehen, der sich nun endlich Taxi-Game leisten kann und damit hofft, mit höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit in die EU zu kommen. Natürlich sind die Lieferwägen, von denen wir immer mal wieder in der Zeitung gelesen haben, die Taxis in diesem Spiel.Vielleicht auch durch meine makro-ökonomische, abstrakte Ausbildung der vergangenen Jahre, hatte ich das Konkrete, die mikro Perspektive aus den Augen verloren. Ich weiß jetzt, dass jede gespendete Powerbank, jedes gespendete Paar Schuhe und jeder gespendete Schlafsack einen konkreten Unterschied machen. Natürlich lösen sich mit dieser Spende nicht die Leiden der Migration in Luft auf, aber wenigstens kann — mit einigem an zwischengeschalteter Logistik — ein Mensch einige Wochen oder Monate später mit warmen Füßen der Familie in 6000 Kilometern Entfernung ein Lebenszeichen senden.Dabei soll dies kein Aufruf zu Spenden sein oder ein unnötiges Drücken auf Tränendrüsen, sondern lediglich die Feststellung, dass es durchaus möglich ist, konkret zu wirken.PS: Naika Foroutan argumentiert hier sehr schlüssig, dabei abstrakt und makro, warum Migration kein Problem ist, sondern über unsere Zukunft entscheidet.PPS: Wir eingangs beschrieben: Diese Arbeit ist auf Unterstützung angewiesen. Falls du dies tun willst, schreib mir gern eine E-Mail. Auch für Anregungen, Kritik und Anmerkungen bin ich über diesen Weg dankbar."

    "snippet": "In einer lauten Welt, die uns mit ihren persönlichen Erfolgen anschreit, bleibt eine ruhig und weise: Meine Oma, die mir die Sinne geöffnet und damit Demut beigebracht hat.Ich hab’ Streusel aus der weißen Rührschüssel stibizt, als du nicht hinsahst. An der hellen, hölzern gerahmten Arbeitsplatte hielt ich mich fest, stieg auf den schweren, roten Schemel und konnte deinen Fingern kaum folgen, wie sie flink die restlichen Streusel über dem ausgerollten Teig verteilten. Die kullerten dann in die hintersten Enden und äußersten Ränder und blieben manchmal erst neben dem Kuchen liegen.Ich dachte immer, du seist gefangen. Von einer Familie, einem herrschenden Mann, einer Kleinstadt, davon, keine Entscheidungen selbst getroffen zu haben. Ich dachte immer, du backst die Trauer über diesen Käfig hinein in die Süße der Streuselkuchen, überdeckst die harten Krusten der Krümel mit dem weichen Schleier der heißen Sahne. Ich dachte, ich wüsste was in dir ist, wie es außerhalb von mir ist.Und dann haben wir Opa in die Erde gelassen. Ich nahm deine Hand und sah auf zu dir, wie du stumm stand’st und mir dann leise ein Lächeln schenktest. Und ich konnte nicht verstehen, wer würde jetzt für dich entscheiden?Du schienst dann zu schrumpfen. Es war Sommer und wir standen in deinem Beet hinterm Haus, meine Augen auf deiner Höhe. Und du sagtest, vegetarisch hättest du kürzlich einen Nussbraten gebacken. Dann stieg mir dieser deftige Duft herzhaftester Nüsse, Sellerie und Möhren in Nase und Rachen und ich sog ihn in mich auf und legte ihn behutsam ab in meiner Vorratskammer der Sinne.Du blickst jetzt hoch zu mir, wenn du fragst, warum der Trump gewählt wurde. Dein Blick richtet sich durch die dicken Gläser deiner Brille hindurch zu mir und du fragst, was wir gegen die AfD noch tun können. Manchmal antworte ich was ich weiß und manchmal weiß ich es nicht. Ich versuche zuzuhören, dich nach deiner und damit meiner Geschichte zu befragen, in deinen Erinnerungen zu kramen, zu hören wie es für dich als Mädchen war und dass es nicht immer wie heute war.Und jetzt ziehst du aus, aus diesem Haus, das dir siebzig Jahre Zuflucht war. Damit reißen auch meine Erinnerungen ein und auch für mich geht diese Zuflucht zu Ende, ohne dass es jemals für mich war, wie es für dich gewesen ist. Auch wenn der Garten geht, bleiben uns die Streusel, die Möhren, die Nüsse.Ganz allein hast du entschieden in ein Heim zu gehen. Still. Ohne dich zu beraten. Ohne die Entscheidung an andere abzugeben. Denn du hast immer entschieden, wen du einlädst und über was wir sprechen. Was du tust, wohin du vereist und dass du anderen hilfst. Du hast nur nicht darüber gesprochen. Weil du mich eher riechen, fühlen und schmecken als hören und sehen gelehrt hast."

    "snippet": "Unten in der Schlucht breitet sich Beton aus. Harter, harter Beton. Hier und da schwirren ein paar Skater herum und oben am Rand steht Katja, beide Beine auf einem Skateboard. Das hintere hält das Brett an der Kante, das vordere hochgestellt schwebt mit der Spitze des Bretts über dem Abgrund. Kurz wird sie noch gehalten, dann lässt sie los, tritt fest nach vorne und stürzt sich hinab, mit dem Skateboard unter den Füßen in die Betonlandschaft.Mal wieder mutig sein, wollte sie. Und mit Mitte vierzig noch einmal Skaten lernen. »Na und dann stehst du da oben und schaust in diese Schlucht und sollst dich da runterstürzen.« Katja lacht, wenn sie erzählt. Ihre Augen leuchten, ihr ganzes Gesicht strahlt und erzählt vom Stolz der Überwindung.Seit vier Wochen skatet sie mit ihrem Sohn am Wochenende. Als sie sich zum ersten Mal traut in die Bowl — in der Skatersprache ist alles auf Englisch, erklärt sie — zu droppen, hat sie nur zwei kurze Übungsläufe hinter sich.Dann wagt sie sich an den hohen Abgrund und stürzt. Beim ersten Versuch und beim zweiten. Aber darum geht es: »Skateboarden hat mich gereizt, weil das nicht so leicht ist,« sagt die Journalistin. Früher war sie beim Vielseitigkeitsreiten häufiger mutig, doch dann kamen die Verpflichtungen sie durfte einfach nicht mehr kaputt gehen. Aber das Skaten muss man üben. Deshalb wartet auf Katja nächste Woche wieder die Betonschlucht."

    "snippet": "Ich fahre mit dem Fahrrad durch den Wedding und meine müde Muskelkraft treibt die schweren, unplattbaren Reifen Umdrehung für Umdrehung dem Kreuzberg entgegen. Es ist nachts. Vereinzelte Blechbüchsen rauschen an mir vorbei. Ich höre Deutschlandradio, wie früher, einfach einschalten und Inhalt. Es läuft Fazit, das Kulturmagazin, als ich einschalte und Gabi Wuttke spricht mit Jürgen Kaube über den soeben verstorbenen Literaturtheoretiker Karl Heinz Bohrer und darüber, dass es der Karl Heinz Bohrer gut fand, wenn jemand die Verhältnisse zum Tanzen bringt. Bohrer machte die geistige Erschütterung durch die Sprache als eine Energie aus, die ein Publikum aus der Gewöhnung austreten lässt. Erst dieses Ende der Langeweile bringt ihm zufolge den bürgerlichen Alltag durcheinander.Wir hatten keinen Zwang zum Ausstieg aus der Gewöhnung, keine Notwendigkeit Raumerfahrung zu vermitteln, als wir uns auf unser neues Wohnmodell einigten: Eine Dreizimmeraltbauwohnung mit Stuck, in bester Lage, einer sehr kleinen Küche, Balkon, drei gemeinsam Wohnenden und dem Manko der strukturellen Ungleichverteilung der Ausgangsbedingungen.Ein Zimmer ist klein und düster. Zwei andere sind groß und hell und zueinander Durchgangszimmer. Die Durchgangszimmer stehen gemeinsam auf, hören einander nicht zuletzt beim Fernsehen und verlangen offene Diskretion. Wie leben also drei Menschen in einer solchen Wohnung miteinander? Ein ökonomisches Allokationsproblem öffentlicher Güter:  Alle zahlen die gleiche Miete, bewohnen ein festes Zimmer und über die Dauer staut sich Unmut an.  Die Nachteile (Größe, Durchgang, Licht) werden im Preis reflektiert. Das helle, große, hintere Durchgangszimmer kann sich nur leisten wer erbt.  Eine Person zieht aus. Zwei verbleiben mit teurerer Miete und einer geschädigten Beziehung.  Umbaumaßnahme: Durchbruch vom hinteren Durchgangszimmer in den Flur. Statisch unmöglich.  Seit 19 Monaten rotieren wir durch die Zimmer. Zu Beginn monatlich, jetzt sobald eine:r der drei wechseln will. In diesem also wiederkehrenden Ritual räumen wir Betten und Schränke, manchmal auch Tische und Stühle, niemals aber Sofas und Bücherregale von hier nach dort und von dort nach dort, dekorieren die Wände um, sortieren aus und saugen an entlegenen Orten. Jedes Mal entstehen neue innenarchitektonische Formationen: Ein neuer Raumteiler hier, eine Büroecke dort, das Klavier ans Fenster oder die Pflanzen inszeniert. Das Bett unter die Hochebene, das Bett auf die Hochebene. Etwa zwei Stunden wird jeweils geräumt. Wir zahlen alle die gleiche Miete, teilen Vor- und Nachteile und lernen die Räume immer wieder neu kennen. Der regelmäßig unerwartete Ausbruch innerhalb der eigenen Wohnung durchbricht die langsame Verrostung jeglichen Wohnalltags. Die Verhältnisse tanzen ständig."

    "snippet": "Es fühle sich fremd an, sagst du, einen Buchstaben so weit hinten im Hals zu formen. Die Rachenmuskulatur zusammenzuziehen, anspannen, etwas Luft hindurchdrücken, dabei den Mund  öffnen, so dass ein »A«-Laut entsteht, der gequetscht klingt. Ein tiefes, gequetschtes »A«. Aber kein klares »A«, vor allem der Quetschlaut, verbindbar auch mit anderen Vokalen oder alleine klingend.Nicht nur fremd fühle er sich an. Er bereite geradezu Anstrengung. Du befürchtest, davon Muskelkater im Rachen zu bekommen. Und du versuchst es noch einmal: Du öffnest deinen Mund  und suchst die Muskulatur, die noch hinter der Kehle liegt. Hinter dem Ort, an dem du gurgelst, noch darunter, fühlst du einen Muskelkranz und spannst dort an. Wie beim Gurgeln presst du dann einen Ton zwischen den diesen Muskeln hindurch, ohne Flattern. Deine Uvula, dein  Zäpfchen, bleibt ruhig hängen und sieht sich deine Arbeit von oben aus an.Lockeres Drücken bringt diese Klangfarbe hervor. Auf Englisch gibt es stimmhafte pharyngale Frikative nicht, auch das Deutsche kennt sie kaum. Aber du willst Arabisch sprechen. Und, obwohl es anstrengende Tonarbeit im Hals ist, wird das ‘Ain, Schriftzeichen: ع, erst schön, wenn es schwerelos erklingt.  ع — [ʕ] […] as if you had opened your mouth under water and constricted your throat to prevent choking and then released the constriction with a sighDein Selbstversuch unter der Dusche endet in wüstem Verschlucken und Husten. Wer übernimmt eine so gefährliche Anleitung in ein Lehrbuch? Nein, du brauchst diese theoretischen Anleitungen nicht. Du kennst den Laut bereits.Du kennst die deutschen Dialekte, hast mit den Lauten gespielt, die Register gezogen und früh die Vielfalt möglicher Laute kennen gelernt. Dir stehen die tiefen Rachenanspannungen eines Niederbayrischen »yuoah mai« zur Verfügung, dieser Aussprache des anerkennenden Desintresses, für das du nach dem »y«-Laut in der Kehle tiefer rutscht und den Rachen aktivierst und durch leichtes Pressen Richtung »oah« entspannst.Du ziehst auch für die schwäbische Betonung deiner Erstplatzierung in »I bin d’ e’rschde« deinen Rachen zusammen. Das »R« versinkt so weiter hinten im Rachen, als es im Hochdeutschen der Fall wäre. Auch dieses Schwäbische »R« ist ein pharyngaler Konsonant. Du kennst die Übung also.Aber dieses arabische ‘Ain sitzt noch tiefer im Schlund. Es bricht aus der Tiefe des Rachens hervor und spiegelt damit nach Ahmad al Farahidi den ersten Laut, die essentielle Stimme und die eigentliche Seele wider. Der arabische Gelehrte des achten Jahrhunderts verfasste das erste arabische Wörterbuch. In seinem Alphabet machte das ‘Ain den Anfang. Die weitere Reihenfolge folgte der Lautbildung nach vorn im Mund, bis zum mit der Spitze der Lippen gehauchten M.Deine Pharyngalerfahrung wird sich also erweitern. Aber deine eigene Sprache enthält bereits die Vielfalt, um im Gegenspiel des Lauteformens mitzuspielen. Und wie bei einem Spiel wirst du weiter üben. Denn noch würgst du Wörter endend mit ‘Ain höflich aus dem Hals."

    "snippet": "Wenn sich früher über Land zwei Jogger entgegenkamen, war es üblich zu Grüßen. Ein Fingerzeig, eine gehobene Hand, ein Nicken, vielleicht sogar ein ländliches ›Servus‹. Zwischen Gerste und Roggen entstand so dieser kurze Moment der Zweisamkeit, wenn man sich begegnete, die Hand kurz hob, während sie dann wieder nach hinten fiel, dem gleichmäßigen Stoßen und Ziehen der Jogginghandbewegung folgend.Man grüßte eher nicht, wenn man überholt wurde oder jemanden überholte. Es gab dieses ungeschriebene Gesetz, dass die Überhol-Schmach nicht auch noch durch einen Gruß markiert werde. Es wurde still und leise überholt. Außer dieses eine Mal, als mir ein vorbeiziehender Rentner bescheinigte, er sei in diesem Alter den Alten davongelaufen.Nach Feldern, einem Wald und entlang eines Flusses führte der letzte Weg meiner Runde damals immer durch ein Wohngebiet. Zurück in der Zivilisation ließ das Gegrüße nach. Zwischen Autos und spielenden Kinden waren auch hier noch manche Jogger unterwegs. Aber je näher an anderem Verkehr, je näher einer Haustüre, desto weniger Jogger-Servus.Später ließ das Grüßen nach. In der Universitätsstadt dachte ich noch, es läge an den vielen Joggern; man käme ja gar nicht mehr heraus aus dem Grüßen. In den Großstädten wurde dann gar nicht mehr beim Joggen gegrüßt. Nun lief man sich unbewegt entgegen. Andere Läufer blieben schlicht eins mit der Masse der Verkehrsteilnehmenden.In der Zeit habe ich so manche irritierten Blicke gesammelt, die meine unvermittelten Grüße auslösten, und wie Schätze verwahrt. Bis zu diesem einen Tag.Es war ein Mittwoch im Sommer und nach drei langen und heißen Wochen regnete es seit um vier Uhr morgens. Mal mehr mal weniger. Die Stadtoberen hatten einen Waschtag beschlossen, zu dem die Luft wieder vollständig hergestellt werden sollte, die Grünflächen gewässert, die Kanalisation überfordert. Im Innenhof konnte ich den Regen mal eher von rechts, dann zeitweise stark von links kommen sehen.Elf Stunden hatte ich dem Regen gelauscht, dann musste ich los. Auf nassen Gehwegplatten, vorbei an kauernden Regenschirmen, hinein in den spärlich besuchten Park. Keine Jogger weit und breit. Dann über die Straße, am Sportplatz entlang, hinein in den nächsten Park.Eine Stunde Sport. Zwei andere Jogger. Zweimal sehr freundlich und enthusiastisch gegrüßt, selbst gegrüßt, zurückgegrüßt, gegrüßt worden. Sogar ohne mein Zutun wäre hier gegrüßt worden.Und da war er wieder. Dieser kurze Moment der Zweisamkeit. Du gehörst dazu. Und du auch. Wir laufen doch alle in den selben nassen Turnschuhen, sagen diese Grüße. Ja, auch ich laufe jetzt geradewegs durch Pfützen. Toll, dass du es rausgeschafft hast. Weiter so. Ein kurzer Moment der Zweisamkeit, der erst in der Einsamkeit entsteht."

    "snippet": "Ich kann mich jetzt schon kaum noch an dieses eigenartige Gefühl von gestern um etwa fünf Uhr morgens erinnern. Dann war es mir so neu, so ungewohnt, so ungewöhnlich vorgekommen. Jetzt schon gehört es wieder zum Reportoir. Seit zwei Wochen liege ich nachts auf meinem Lager, bestehend aus einem Futon und einem Kissen. Decken sind seit kürzlich nicht nur überflüssig, sogar hinderlich geworden bei dem Versuch in Seesternstellung keine Hautpartie in der Nähe einer anderen Hautpartie zu spüren; So, dass nicht einmal die glühende Aura und der Schweisfilm des eigenen Körpers dem eigenen Körper nahe kommt.Häufig vergebens, dennoch auf dem Rücken liegend, ständig in der Hoffnung leicht zu schweben, sodass weniger Schweiß in den Futon einsinkt, nicht diese kleine, ständig wachsende Pfütze sich wie ein Leck unter meinen Lenden bildet.Seit zwei Wochen bin ich ein Seestern. Und dann gestern das überraschende Gefühl. Ein leichtes Frösteln gegen fünf Uhr morgens. Zuerst kaum zuordenbar, was hat mich da sanft aber bestimmt aus dem Schlaf gezogen? Welche körperliche Sensation umspielt meine Sinne?Vom Innenhof her tropft seit einer Woche die erste Briese durch den Vorhang herein. Die körperkühlende Funktion des Schweises feiert ihren Triumpf, weckt mich dafür sogar auf und sagt: Siehst du, Schwitzen kühlt eben doch.Nach zwei längeren Regengüssen ist dieses leichte Frösteln wieder in den Fundus erwartbarer Sensationen übergegangen. Ich habe wieder eine leichte Sommerdecke bezogen und bin nicht mehr allein im Bett. Die Hitze lähmt nicht mehr. Das fröhliche Frösteln bringt Kontakte wieder. Haut an Decke. Haut an Haut. Das fröhliche Frösteln beendet die Einsamkeit."

    "snippet": "Durch den Rheinauhafen glitzert die Abendsonne. In ganz Köln lockt heute eine einzige Kulturveranstaltung. Short Story Night, fünf Kurzgeschichten, gelesen von echten Autor:innen, die mit dem Wind und der Mikrofoneinstellung kämpfen. Für alle ist der Ton etwas leise und niemand kann einfach für sich etwas lauter drehen. Eine von uns ruft schon bald laut LAUTER.Fünfzehnt Euro Eintritt, negativer Corona-Test und festgelegte Sitzplätze, etwas der Tischbühne entrückt. Keine direkte Sicht ins Gesicht der Lesenden, der Blickwinkel eher von oben herab, auf den ganzen sprechenden Menschen, inklusive der Beine.Die Sitzplätze sind auf steinernen Rängen markiert, zwei Polster pro Person. Die Ränge reichen zum Wasser hinab. Eine Sichtbetonwand fasst Ränge und Wasser ein. Niedrige Geländer trennen die Ränge von einem Weg entlang der Wand.Unser Blick schweift noch durch den Raum, sieht Spaziergänger auf den Wegen entlang schlendern. Wir lauschen den Geschichten, sie genießen den Abend.Während der ersten Kurzgeschichte bleiben Passant:innen länger stehen und spitzen die Ohren. Mit der zweiten Kurzgeschichte lassen sich außerhalb der Balustrade Hörer:innen nieder. Mittlerweile hört eine Mutter die restlichen Geschichten des Abends von außerhalb, stillt. Der Begleiter entpackt Getränke. Die beiden sind dabei. Ohne Eintrittsgeld, ohne markierten Sitzplatz, auf einem der Wege, die die Ränge einfassen. Vor der Balustrade haben sie Platz genommen, sehen durch das Geländer hindurch, lauschen dem über Lautsprecher übertragenen Ton.Wir sitzen hier im Innen, auf markierten Sitzplätzen mit Test, mit Eintrittskarte, mit Zugang zur Bar. Wir sitzen im reinlichen Innen, dessen Hygieneregeln das Tragen einer Maske auf dem Weg zur Toilette vorschreiben. Sie sitzen im Außen auf dem harten Boden der Wirklichkeit, frei zu gehen und zu bewegen. Keine Hygieneregeln, keine Aufsicht, kein Eintrittsgeld.Wenn wir genau hinsehen, dann fühlt es sich an, als streckten sie uns geradewegs die Zunge heraus: Unsere Festlegung auf den Termin, unseren Wunsch nach flauschig-weichen Sitzpolstern und unsere Eintrittsgelder verlachend. Wenn wir noch genauer hinsehen, dann bemerken wir diese Gelassenheit derer dort draußen. Zufrieden über den glücklichen Zufall, spontan einer Lesung beiwohnen zu können, voller Dankbarkeit gegenüber den Organisator:innen, ohne Erwartungen und Ansprüche.Wie wir nach den Zaungästen lechzen, sie bewundern. Wie die Zaungäste uns provozieren. Wie die Zaungäste die Grenzen des Raums verschwimmen lassen. Wo Innen und Außen ist, wird diffus. Der Ton lässt sich nicht einfangen. Wie die Zaungäste in Frage stellen, was richtig und falsch ist, wie Teilhabe funktioniert.An- oder abwesend, Getestet oder nicht getestet, bezahlt oder nicht bezahlt, stumm gestellt oder Kamera an. Zaungäste können einfach gehen, getestet sein, hinterher freiwillig spenden und ungefragt dazwischen quatschen. Ist die Zaungastschaft nicht Rebellion?"
